# UM-Bridge Workshop 2022

UM-Bridge is an easy to use and language-agnostic software interface for coupling Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods to numerical models. It enables containerization of models for portability and reproducibility as well as access to cloud platforms. For details on UM-Bridge and a library of ready to run  UQ benchmarks, see [UM-Bridge documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/).

This workshop has the following goals:

* Teach how to use UM-Bridge
* Initiate new collaborations between UQ and model experts
* Advance the UQ software ecosystem through common interfaces, unified benchmarks and access to cloud-based HPC

## Time and Location

The workshop will be held online and span two days:
* Monday, December 12, 09:00 - 17:00 CET
* Tuesday, December 13, 09:00 - 17:00 CET
