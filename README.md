# UM-Bridge Workshop 2023

![UM-Bridge logo](/UM-bridge.png)

UM-Bridge is a language-agnostic software interface linking Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and numerical models. It allows

* Speeding up UQ projects from prototype to HPC
* UQ experts to make their codes usable for a wide audience
* Model experts to access advanced UQ packages
* Running reproducible, community-defined UQ benchmarks

This workshop has the following goals:

* Get users familiar with UM-Bridge
* Advance the UQ software ecosystem
* Initiate collaborations between UQ and model experts

## Organizers

* Anne Reinarz [anne.k.reinarz@durham.ac.uk](mailto:anne.k.reinarz@durham.ac.uk)
* Linus Seelinger [mail@linusseelinger.de](mailto:mail@linusseelinger.de)
