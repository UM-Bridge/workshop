# UM-Bridge Workshop 2022

![UM-Bridge logo](/UM-bridge.png)

UM-Bridge is an easy to use and language-agnostic software interface for coupling Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods to numerical models. It enables containerization of models for portability and reproducibility as well as access to cloud platforms. For details on UM-Bridge and a library of ready to run  UQ benchmarks, see [UM-Bridge documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/).

This workshop has the following goals:

* Teach how to use UM-Bridge
* Initiate new collaborations between UQ and model experts
* Advance the UQ software ecosystem through common interfaces, unified benchmarks and access to cloud-based HPC

## Organizers

* Anne Reinarz [anne.k.reinarz@durham.ac.uk](mailto:anne.k.reinarz@durham.ac.uk)
* Linus Seelinger [linus.seelinger@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de](mailto:linus.seelinger@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de)

## Time and Location

The workshop will be held online and span two days:
* Monday, December 12, 10:00 - 18:00 CET
* Tuesday, December 13, 10:00 - 18:00 CET

We plan to use gather.town as our online platform; details are TBA.

## Registration

Registration is available through the [registration form](https://forms.gle/ndMiRwB7mpiLxrpM8), up to the limit of 50 participants.

## Introduction session

We will have a short session where each participant may (optionally) introduce themselves and say a few words about their research interests and current projects. This is supposed to help in finding interesting discussion partners. If you'd like to participate and show something, please send me up to 3 PDF slides until Saturday (Dec. 10); I will compile them in a single document to avoid delays in between.

## Prerequisites

For practical exercises, you will need working installations of
* docker (available at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/))
* Python

## Schedule

Times below in CET (GMT+1).

*Italic: Invited talks about ongoing UQ projects involving UM-Bridge.*
