# UM-Bridge Workshop 2025

![UM-Bridge logo](/UM-bridge.png)

UM-Bridge is a language-agnostic interface linking Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) packages and numerical model software. It allows

* Speeding up UQ projects from prototype to HPC
* Making UQ and model software available to a wide audience
* Reproducible, community-driven UQ benchmarking

For more information, see [UM-Bridge documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/).

This workshop has the following goals:

* Get users familiar with UM-Bridge
* Initiate collaborations between UQ and model experts
* Advance the UQ software ecosystem
