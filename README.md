# UM-Bridge Workshop 2024

![UM-Bridge logo](/UM-bridge.png)

UM-Bridge is a language-agnostic interface linking Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) packages and numerical model software. It allows

* Speeding up UQ projects from prototype to HPC
* Making UQ and model software available to a wide audience
* Reproducible, community-driven UQ benchmarking

For more information, see [UM-Bridge documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/).

This workshop has the following goals:

* Get users familiar with UM-Bridge
* Initiate collaborations between UQ and model experts
* Advance the UQ software ecosystem

## Organizers

* Anne Reinarz [anne.k.reinarz@durham.ac.uk](mailto:anne.k.reinarz@durham.ac.uk)
* Linus Seelinger [mail@linusseelinger.de](mailto:mail@linusseelinger.de)

## Time and Location

The workshop will be held online and span two days:
* Thursday, December 5 2024, 11:00 - 17:00 CET
* Friday, December 6 2024, 11:00 - 18:00 CET

We will use gather.town as our online platform.

## Registration
